Pseudocode: ccnumber = credit card number

Define Luhnalgorithm (ccnumber):
	Make input credit card number a string
Split into a list of ‘digits’
Change strings back into integers

Loop that starts with -2: range(-2, 0, -2)
Doubles every number chosen in the loop
For double digits it adds them up using 2D lists


Sum up all the numbers
If number is divisible by 10: 
the number is valid
Else:
 it is not


		Define digitchecker(ccnumber):
			For each element in ccnumber
			If the number is a digit:
				Return True
			Else:
				Break
		
		Define firstnumbers(ccnumber):
			If ccnumber starts with 4,5,6 or 37:
				Return True
			Else:
				Break
		
	
		Define cclength(ccnumber):
			If credit card number is more or equal to 13 and less than or equal to 16:
				Return True
			Else:
				Break


		
		If digitchecker(ccnumber) and firstnumbers(ccnumber) and cclength(ccnumber):
			Luhnalgorithm(ccnumber)
